		<p> The Future of Hydroponic Farms is here! </p>
<h1>History</h1>
Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil.
The word hydroponics technically means working water, stemming from the Latin words "hydro" meaning water, and "ponos" meaning labor. 
Advantages of Hydroponics:
Shorter growth cycles while producing higher yields
Reduction of cost and processing
Effortless labor 
Consistent, better tasting crops
Various environmental concerns, reduction in arable land, and scarcity of water can be easily conquered with the use of hydroponics.
</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
While Hydroponic farming has many advantages, one of the key disadvantages to this farming technique is the constant need to monitor key indicators of the plantâ€™s growth, such as {water salienty, air temperature, and nutrient content.} </p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
Bona Petite is a self-contained, plug and play component that is maintained with a series of Arduino controllers. Air temperature, pH level and nutrient levels are all maintained via the Arduino's. 

The Arduino's are networked to a Raspberry Pi using I2C to allow all system parameters to be monitored and updated in real time. The Raspberry Pi is further used to maintain a historical log of all the systems running data and make it available via an API. 

A companion web app interacts with the Raspberry Pi allowing monitoring your entire system from anywhere in the world.

Benefits of Bona Petite:
Maintained by micro-controllers (Raspberry Pi & Arduino)
Plant nutrients and pH - monitor and alerts
Temperature monitoring
Smart and Connected

Alert notifications via email when not ideal conditions
