<h1> History </h1>
<p>Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil.

<p>The word hydroponics technically means working water, stemming from the Latin words "hydro" meaning water, and "ponos" meaning labor.</p>

<li>Advantages of Hydroponics:</li>
<li>Shorter growth cycles while producing higher yields</li>
<li>Reduction of cost and processing</li>
<li>Effortless labor</li> 
<li>Consistent, better tasting crops</li>
<li>Various environmental concerns, reduction in arable land, and scarcity of water can be easily conquered with the use of hydroponics.</li>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>While Hydroponic farming has many advantages, one of the key disadvantages to this farming technique is the constant need to monitor key indicators of the plantâ€™s growth, such as {water salienty, air temperature, and nutrient content.} </p>

<h3><blockquote>The Solution</blockquote></h3>
<p>Bona Petite is a self-contained, plug and play component that is maintained with a series of Arduino controllers. Air temperature, pH level and nutrient levels are all maintained via the Arduino's. 

The Arduino's are networked to a Raspberry Pi using I2C to allow all system parameters to be monitored and updated in real time. The Raspberry Pi is further used to maintain a historical log of all the systems running data and make it available via an API. 

A companion web app interacts with the Raspberry Pi allowing monitoring your entire system from anywhere in the world.

<h3>Benefits of Bona Petite:</h3>
<li>Maintained by micro-controllers (Raspberry Pi & Arduino)</li>
<li>pH and Temperature monitoring</li>
<li>Smart and Connected Bona Petite web app</li>
<li>Alert notifications via email when not ideal conditions are not met</li>
