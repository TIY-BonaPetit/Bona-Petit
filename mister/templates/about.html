<h3> History </h3>
<div class='textbox'>
	<p>Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants
		using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. The word hydroponics
		technically means working water, stemming from the Latin words "hydro" meaning
		water, and "ponos" meaning labor.</p>
</div>

<h3>Advantages of Hydroponics:</h3>
<div id='aboutlist'>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Shorter growth cycles<p></li>
		<li><p>Higher yields<p></li>
		<li><p>Reduced processing costs</p></li>
		<li><p>Effortless labor</p></li>
		<li><p>More consistent crop aging and flavor</p></li>
		<li><p>Small farming space</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<div class='textbox'>
	<p>While Hydroponic farming has many advantages, one of the key disadvantages
		to this farming technique is the constant need to monitor key indicators
		of the plantâ€™s growth, such as water salienty, air temperature, and
		nutrient content.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<div class='textbox'>
	<p>Bona Petite is a self-contained, plug and play system component that is maintained
		with a series of Arduino controllers. Air temperature, Electroconductivity level and nutrient
		levels are all maintained via the Arduinos. The Arduinos are networked
		to a Raspberry Pi using I2C to allow all system parameters to be monitored
		and updated in real time. The Raspberry Pi is further used to maintain a
		historical log of all the systems running data and make it available via
		an API. A companion web app interacts with the Raspberry Pi allowing monitoring
		your entire system from anywhere in the world.</p>
</div>

<h3>Benefits of Bona Petite:</h3>
<div id='aboutlist'>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Maintained by an Arduino micro-controller and a RaspberryPi motherboard</p></li>
		<li><p>Solution concentration and temperature monitoring</p></li>
		<li><p>Smart and connected Bona Petite web app</p></li>
		<li><p>Alert notifications via email when ideal conditions are not met</p></li>
	<ul>
</div>

<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<div class='textbox'>
	<p>Bona Petite is still in its infancy of production, but moving forward, the capability
		of SMS updates will provide for even quicker notifications of key indicators. With the additon of a built-in solar panel, Bona Petite will be able to fully function without connecting to a power source. Users will be able to customize which sensors they are using with an easy edit feature. Lastly, the web app will be updated with all selections of plants which can be grown hydroponically to notify the user of particular ideal conditions, respectively.</p>
