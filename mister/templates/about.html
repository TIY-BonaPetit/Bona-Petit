		<h1> About </h1>
		<p> Bona Petite is the leader in arduino board farming techniques! </p>
		<p>Bona Petite is a play on words meaning “a little good”. And that’s what we hope to accomplish with our program. We’re building a computer system that monitors an environment to ensure optimal conditions for a growth. This concept is designed with hydroponics in mind, but can easily be integrated into other environments. The sensor hardware in use is managed by specialized C/C++ scripts designed for Arduino micro-controllers. A RaspberryPi computer, using a custom Python script, acts as a bridge between our micro-controller and a web database deployed with Heroku.</p>
