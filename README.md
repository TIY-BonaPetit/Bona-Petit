# Bona-Petite

## Synopsis

####BENEFITS OF BONA PETITE:

Maintained by an Arduino micro-controller and a RaspberryPi motherboard
Solution concentration and temperature monitoring
Smart and connected Bona Petite web app
Alert notifications via email when ideal conditions are not met

######FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Bona Petite is still in its infancy moving forward, the capability of SMS updates will provide even quicker notifications of key indicators.


The system will draw its power from a built-in solar panel.


## Code Example

*Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.*


## Motivation

THE SOLUTION
Bona Petite is a self-contained, plug and play component that is maintained with a series of Arduino controllers. Air temperature and nutrient levels are all maintained via the Arduino's. The Arduino's are networked to a Raspberry Pi using I2C to allow all system parameters to be monitored and updated in real time. The Raspberry Pi is further used to maintain a historical log of all the systems running data and make it available via an API. A companion web app interacts with the Raspberry Pi allowing monitoring your entire system from anywhere in the world.


## Installation

*Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.*

## API Reference

*Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.*

## Tests

*Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.*

## Contributors

*Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.*

## License

*A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)*
